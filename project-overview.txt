Spotify and YouTube 2024 - Project Overview
Hunter Rings

I was curious about whether there were any significant differences or trends in the number of Spotify streams for popular songs compared to their YouTube views.

After reviewing the data, it does seem like Spotify is generally a more popular platform for music. There are a few artists that stick out as far as doing much better
on one platform or another, but there are also many who do well in both (The Weeknd appeared in the top 3 for Spotify and YouTube, for example).

i would have liked to have done some more complex or advanced statistical modeling based on this data, but the cleaning and formatting process took much longer than
I anticipated. I hope that what I have so far here is at least somewhat interesting, but in any case I think this would be a solid starting point for furhter analysis.
